To run your frontend and backend as services on Windows, you can use the Windows Service Manager. 
However, Windows services typically run as Windows services, which require specific configuration 
and setup. Below are the general steps to create and install Windows services for your frontend and backend applications:

Step 1: Create Service Scripts

Create separate scripts or batch files for your frontend and backend applications if 
you haven't already. These scripts should start your applications as background processes.

For example, you can create two batch files: start_frontend_service.bat and start_backend_service.bat.

Step 2: Convert to Windows Service

To install these batch files as Windows services, you can use a tool like NSSM (Non-Sucking Service Manager), which simplifies the process. Here's how to do it:

Download NSSM from the official website: https://nssm.cc/download.

Extract the downloaded zip file to a directory.

Open Command Prompt with administrator privileges.

Navigate to the directory where you extracted NSSM.

Use NSSM to create a service for your frontend and backend:

* batch 
Copy code
nssm install FrontendService
nssm set FrontendService Application C:\path\to\your\frontend\start_frontend_service.bat
batch
Copy code
nssm install BackendService
nssm set BackendService Application C:\path\to\your\backend\start_backend_service.bat
Replace C:\path\to\your\frontend\start_frontend_service.bat and C:\path\to\your\backend\start_backend_service.bat with the actual paths to your batch files.

Configure other settings like startup type, etc., through the NSSM interface if needed.

Step 3: Start and Manage Services

After creating the services, you can start and manage them using standard Windows service management tools:

Open the Services application by typing "services" into the Windows search bar.

Find your services ("FrontendService" and "BackendService") in the list.

Right-click on each service, select "Start" to start them, and "Stop" to stop them.

These services will run in the background like typical Windows services.

Please note that setting up Windows services might require administrator privileges, and you should test
these configurations in a safe environment before deploying them in a production environment.
Also, consult the documentation for NSSM or any other service manager tool you choose for more advanced configuration options.
